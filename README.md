# DoIt
Procrastination Station, NOT!
A simple console app made in C#. 
A user enters in a few choices of things on his/her to do list for the day and the app randomly ranks them in order of doing them or gives you one task at a time to do right now!

Hopefully it will help someone's procrastination game get a bit slower ;)
